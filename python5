To solve the problem of determining whether two integers 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b form a "Oneful Pair" as defined by the condition 
𝑎
+
𝑏
+
(
𝑎
⋅
𝑏
)
=
111
a+b+(a⋅b)=111, you can simply perform the arithmetic directly based on the given inputs and check if the sum matches 111.

Here's a Python script that achieves this:

python

# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the sum
sum_expression = a + b + (a * b)

# Check if the sum equals 111
if sum_expression == 111:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
